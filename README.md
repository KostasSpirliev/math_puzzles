Here you can find some tiny pieces of code and reports in R, which I wrote for myself to solve some curious maths-pizzles:
1. multiple_comparisons_problem &mdash; here I provide some simulations functions in R to demonstrate multiple comparisons problem in statistics + optimize these functions by profvis R package. The rendered report (on Russian): https://rpubs.com/KostasSpirliev/631668 <p align="center"> <img width="400" height="300" src="https://github.com/KostasSpirliev/math_puzzles/blob/master/multiple_comparisons_problem/mult_comp_problem.png"> </p>
2. pi_calculation &mdash; here I am solving curious math+cs puzzle of calculation the value of pi only by uniform random distribution function (*runif* in R). Full rendered report with task description and completed solution (on Russian): https://rpubs.com/KostasSpirliev/627938
